## Fundimentals

*Cloud* -> `The term cloud is used as a metaphor for the Internet, based on how the Internet is
depicted in computer network diagrams and is an abstraction for the complex infrastructure
it conceals.`

*Cloud* -> A network that delivers requested virtual resources as a service.

 • `Hosting` refers to fixed, dedicated resources.
 • `Web hosting` refers to hosted and dedicated web applications and web content.
 • `SaaS` are shared applications accessed as a service (more on this in a later unit).
 • `PaaS` refers to platform provided as a service (more on this in a later unit)
 • `IaaS` is infrastructure provided as a service (as well....more on this in a later unit)
 • `Infrastructure utility` is industrialized computing resources (or those resources that have been commoditized).
 • `Web applications` are provider dedicated web applications and web content.

### Key characteristics of cloud computing

• On-demand self-service
  – Focuses on delivering IT services driven by user requests
  – No human interaction with the cloud provider
  – Cloud computing provides a means of delivering computing services that make the underlying technology, beyond the user device, almost invisible
• Ubiquitous network access
  – Focuses on delivering IT services anytime, anywhere, and through user-chosen devices
  – Users accessing services via Internet technologies expect a secure, “always-on” computing infrastructure that delivers as easily and reliably as electricity from a wall outlet
• Pool of virtualized resources
  – Focuses on delivering IT services through resource pools that can expand and contract based on the requirements of the underlying workload and the usage characteristics
• Utility-based pricing
  – Focuses on delivering IT services that can be metered for usage and charged for (if needed) through pricing models including subscription, usage pricing
  – Service level agreements (SLAs)

### Why use cloud

• Better capital utilization
  – Pay-as-you-go
  – The unit cost of on-demand capacity may be higher than the unit cost per time unit of fixed capacity; offset by no charge when capacity is not being used
• Accelerate software development, deployment, and testing
  – Fast provisioning of resources
• Elasticity of resources
  – Scalable and flexible use of resources
• Access to complex infrastructure and resources without internal resources
• Support for geographically distributed users
• New business opportunities

### How clouds are changing IT

 • Changing the economics of IT:
  – Cloud computing is driving operational efficiencies in IT through better use of resources.
 • Automating service delivery:
  – The term self service means that developers and testers can directly procure the resources they need to complete their tasks without going through lengthy procurement chains. This results in a significantly shortened procurement period, and it means that developers and testers can quickly get to the task at hand.
 • Exploiting standardization:
  – Access to clouds is through standard Internet transports and protocols, providing access to a range of user devices.
 • Rapidly deploying new capabilities:
  – Test and operation teams may have different conventions and configurations from development teams, and this can lead to unintended application behavior and delays.

### Driving factors towards cloud computing

• Poorly utilized resources driving up hardware and labor costs
  – Setting up a new environment is expensive; there is an incentive to hold on to them “just in case”
  – Each new project requisitions new hardware instead of recycling unused hardware; this takes time and money
• Takes too long to create middleware infrastructures
  – Average lead time to get a new application environment is 4–6 weeks
  – Approvals, procurement, shipment, hardware installation, license procurement, OS installation, configuration, application installation
• Creating middleware infrastructures is a manual process and error prone
  – Minor differences in configurations can introduce errors or bugs that are difficult to detect
  – Often only emerge when moving from test to production

• Each application must be sized to support peak load
  – Idle resources during non-peak times
• Inability to use idle resources to handle extra load
  – Quality of service may suffer during periods of exceptional load

### Concerns related to cloud computing

• Maturity
  – Is the technology ready for production-level deployment?
• Standards
  – Still being developed
• Security concerns
  – Multiple customers sharing the same resources
• Interoperability
  – Many different vendor APIs
• Control of data
  – Organizational level of comfort with data being outside traditional IT

• Google
• Azure

### Elasticity and scalability
