Software by oppoisition is high complextiy but low risk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over my carrer of 10 years as a software developer Ive ntocied a trend with those that I consider to be sucessful and ive often been told that sucess leaves clues. The trend in question was a air of fearlessness when it came to failure, and failure in terms of deploying software specifically.</p>\n<p>Though, what does failing forward look like? I mean, can it be done in a productive sense so you don't frustrate your co-workers? Saying to someone, \"Hey, failing forward is the key\" is all fine and dandy, but what happens when you <em>fail forward</em> and shit can production?  </p>\n<p>The truth is, failing forward is an exceptionally difficult paradigm to follow because its basically frowned upon for business value. Up time counts, user satisfaction counts, <strong>quality</strong> counts. Over time, the pattern of failing foward may have become apparent to me, but a dark pattern also came with it; pretending you don't. No one wants to admit they fail forward, it shakes confidence. </p>\n<p>So, if failing forward is at such odds(useful but dangerous), how can we implement it as a viable delivery model?</p>"
