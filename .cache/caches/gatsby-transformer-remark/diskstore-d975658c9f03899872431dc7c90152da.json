  "val": "<p><em>VueJS Amsterdam 2019 - The Best Bits</em></p>\n<p>So this week I attended VueJS Amsterdam and it was a blast. Over the years Ive been to various software conferences(UX/DX, ReactConf, JSConf, JSBrazil, etc) and out of all of the conferences Ive been to, VueJS Amsterdam might have been the best. </p>\n<p>2 years ago my company, VSWare adopted a very early Vue.js setup as our main FE framework over others we had considered(react, Rivets, backbone, ember). We had needed something plug and play that would sit into our main applicationâ€™s archatecture without too much time being wasted on intergration. Our stack today is: tomcat, Java 8, maven, SQL, Vue, jQuery and SCSS.</p>\n<p>Given Vue has picked up so much popularity in the FE world over the last year, I wanted to see what the state of the community was in, and pick up a few tricks for my own work life.</p>\n<p><em>This is what I learned</em></p>\n<h2>The state of Vue 3.0</h2>\n<p>Evan You kicked things off on the Thursday with a breakdown of the current state of things within the Vue ecosystem and whats new in not only Vue 2.6 but also Vue 3.0. </p>\n<p>We were all hoping he might consider a early release during the conference but alas, it wasnt to be. </p>\n<h2>Composing Components</h2>\n<h2>5 rules for performant Vue Applications</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Lazy Load Everything </li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>NuxtJS - Whats new?</h2>\n<h2>Accessability in a Vue SPA</h2>\n<h2>Lazy Load All The Things</h2>"
